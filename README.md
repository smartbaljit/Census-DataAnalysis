# Project1_Census_Google
The first group project. Group members are Baljit Alang, Rick Cavalla, Marc Donatiello, Haarris Haque, Mark Visco

Purpose: We wanted to see if we could find any correlation between the socioeconomic demographics of a geographic area (New Jersey) and the restaurants in that area

Method: We extracted data from Google Places API and US Census data. 

Data used: We used household income of a certain area code using the zip code, and plotted it against the average price threshold provided to us
